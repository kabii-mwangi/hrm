## What Has Been Changed

I have successfully modified the Annual Leave Award System based on your requirements:

1. **Removed automatic date-based awards** - No more automatic July awards
2. **Added manual "Start New Financial Year" functionality** - HR managers can manually start new financial years
3. **Added financial year filtering** - Leave management now has filtering by financial year

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Manual Financial Year Control** (`annual_leave_award_new.php`)

### 2. **Updated Annual Leave Management Interface** (`annual_leave_management.php`)

## How It Works Now
