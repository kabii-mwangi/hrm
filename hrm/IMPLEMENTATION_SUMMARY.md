# Annual Leave Award System - Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Annual Leave Award System for your HR system that automatically awards 30 days of leave to permanently employed employees at the beginning of each financial year (July).

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Core Award System** (`annual_leave_award.php`)
- Automatically identifies permanent employees
- Calculates pro-rated leave for employees hired mid-year
- Prevents duplicate awards for the same financial year
- Updates leave balances in the database
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

### 2. **Management Interface** (`annual_leave_management.php`)
- Web-based interface for HR managers
- Manual award processing capability
- View award history and logs
- Employee eligibility checking
- Force award option for special cases

### 3. **Automated Scheduling** (`cron_annual_leave.php`)
- Cron job script for automatic awards
- Runs at the beginning of each financial year
- Email notifications to administrators
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. **Database Integration**
- New `annual_leave_award_logs` table for audit trail
- Integration with existing `leave_balances` table
- Proper indexing for performance
- Foreign key relationships maintained

### 5. **Navigation Integration**
- Added "Annual Leave Awards" menu item to dashboard
- Restricted access to HR managers and super admins
- Seamless integration with existing UI

### 6. **Testing and Validation**
- Test script to verify system functionality
- Database update script for easy deployment
- Comprehensive error handling
- Dry-run capability for testing

## How It Works

### Financial Year Logic
- Financial year runs from July to June
- Current year calculation based on month
- Example: July 2024 - June 2025 = "2024-2025"

### Award Process
1. **Eligibility Check**: Identifies permanent, active employees
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if award already given for current financial year
3. **Pro-rating Calculation**: For employees hired after July 1st
4. **Database Updates**: Updates leave_balances and logs award
5. **Notifications**: Optional email notifications

### Pro-rating Formula
```
Days Awarded = (Remaining months in financial year / 12) Ã— 30 days
Minimum award: 1 day
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `annual_leave_award.php` - Core award logic
- `annual_leave_management.php` - Web interface
- `cron_annual_leave.php` - Cron job script
- `database_updates.sql` - Database schema updates
- `run_db_updates.php` - Database update runner
- `test_annual_leave.php` - System testing
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup instructions
- `ANNUAL_LEAVE_SYSTEM.md` - System documentation

### Modified Files
- `dashboard.php` - Added navigation menu item

## Database Changes

### New Table: `annual_leave_award_logs`
Tracks all annual leave awards with:
- Employee ID and financial year
- Days awarded and award type
- Calculation details and notes
- Award method (automatic/manual/cron)
- Timestamp and awarded by user

### Enhanced Table: `leave_balances`
- Added performance index
- Ensured proper integration

### Enhanced Table: `employees`
- Added `employment_type` column if missing

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
php run_db_updates.php
```

### 2. Test System
```bash
php test_annual_leave.php
```

### 3. Set Up Cron Job
```bash
# Add to crontab for automatic awards on July 1st at 6 AM
0 6 1 7 * /usr/bin/php /path/to/hrm/cron_annual_leave.php
```

### 4. Access Management Interface
- Log in as HR Manager or Super Admin
- Navigate to "Annual Leave Awards" in sidebar
- Use interface to manually award or view history

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can access
- **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with user information
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot award twice for same year
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Benefits

1. **Automated Process**: No manual intervention required
2. **Accurate Calculations**: Pro-rating for mid-year hires
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all awards
4. **Flexible**: Can be run manually or automatically
5. **Secure**: Proper access controls and validation
6. **Scalable**: Handles large numbers of employees
7. **Maintainable**: Well-documented and tested code

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Updates**: Execute `php run_db_updates.php`
2. **Test the System**: Run `php test_annual_leave.php`
3. **Set Up Cron Job**: Add the cron job for automatic awards
4. **Train HR Staff**: Show them how to use the management interface
5. **Monitor**: Check logs after first automated run

The system is now ready for production use and will automatically award 30 days of annual leave to all permanently employed employees at the beginning of each financial year (July).
