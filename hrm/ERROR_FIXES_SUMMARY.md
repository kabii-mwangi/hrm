# Error Fixes Applied to leave_management.php

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Line 1098 - Null Value Error**
**Problem**: Accessing array keys without checking if they exist, causing "value of type null" errors.

**Solution**: Added null coalescing operators (`??`) to provide default values:
```php
// Before (causing null errors)
if ($user['role'] === 'dept_head') {
    $employeesQuery .= " WHERE e.department_id = " . (int)$userEmployee['department_id'];
}

// After (with null safety)
if (isset($user['role']) && $user['role'] === 'dept_head') {
    $employeesQuery .= " WHERE e.department_id = " . (int)($userEmployee['department_id'] ?? 0);
}
```

### 2. **Line 2121 - Missing File Include**
**Problem**: Code was trying to include 'leave_management_handler.php' which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Removed the problematic include and duplicate code:
```php
// Removed this problematic section:
// include 'leave_management_handler.php';
// ... duplicate approval code ...
```

## All Null Safety Fixes Applied

### User Role Access
- `$user['role']` → `$user['role'] ?? 'employee'`
- Added `isset($user['role'])` checks where appropriate

### User Employee Data Access  
- `$userEmployee['id']` → `$userEmployee['id'] ?? 0`
- `$userEmployee['department_id']` → `$userEmployee['department_id'] ?? 0`
- `$userEmployee['section_id']` → `$userEmployee['section_id'] ?? 0`
- `$userEmployee['employee_id']` → `$userEmployee['employee_id'] ?? ''`
- `$userEmployee['first_name']` → `$userEmployee['first_name'] ?? ''`
- `$userEmployee['last_name']` → `$userEmployee['last_name'] ?? ''`

### Role Hierarchy Access
- `$role_hierarchy[$user['role']]` → `$role_hierarchy[$user['role'] ?? 'employee']`

## Code Cleanup

### Removed Duplicate Code
- Removed duplicate approval handling code that was placed after HTML closing tags
- Removed non-existent file include
- Cleaned up orphaned PHP code blocks

### Improved Error Handling
- Added proper null checks throughout the file
- Ensured all array access is safe
- Provided meaningful default values

## Files Modified
- `hrm/leave_management.php` - Main fixes applied
- Created this summary document

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test leave application submission with different user roles
2. Test approval workflows with various employee types  
3. Verify no null value errors occur during normal operations
4. Check that all dropdowns and forms work correctly

The system should now run without the reported null value and missing file errors.
