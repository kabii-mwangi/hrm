# Consolidated Leave Days Calculation - Summary

## What Was Done

All leave days calculation functionality has been consolidated into a single file: `leave_management.php`

## Changes Made to `leave_management.php`

### 1. **Enhanced Calculation Functions**
- **`calculateLeaveDays()`** - Determines calculation method based on leave type
- **`calculateCalendarDays()`** - Calculates total calendar days (for maternity leave)
- **Updated `calculateBusinessDays()`** - Excludes weekends and holidays properly

### 2. **Integrated AJAX Endpoint**
- Added AJAX handler at the top of the file: `?ajax=calculate_days`
- Handles POST requests for real-time leave calculation
- Returns JSON response with calculated days and explanations
- No separate PHP file needed

### 3. **Integrated Test Function**
- Added test handler: `?test=leave_calculation`
- Comprehensive testing of different scenarios
- Access via: `leave_management.php?test=leave_calculation`
- No separate test file needed

### 4. **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Dynamic calculation** updates as users select dates/leave type
- **Visual indicators** showing calculation method
- **Leave type descriptions** with weekend/holiday inclusion notes
- **Inline JavaScript** - no external JS files

### 5. **Smart Leave Calculation Logic**

#### For Most Leave Types (Annual, Sick, Paternity, Study, Short, Compassionate):
- ✅ **Excludes weekends** (Saturday & Sunday)
- ✅ **Excludes holidays** (from holidays table)
- ✅ **Shows**: "X days (Excludes weekends and holidays)"

#### For Maternity Leave:
- ✅ **Includes weekends** (Saturday & Sunday)
- ✅ **Includes holidays**
- ✅ **Shows**: "X days (Includes weekends and holidays)"
